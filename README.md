# Hack-Assembler

I created this assembler as a self-study project while using "The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer form First 
Principles" as a guide. The assembler works with 16-bit mnemonics and translates them into their 16-bit machine instructions via
a one-to-one mnemonic-to-instruction correspondence.
